# NIOS - Scriptable Wrapper
This library's main focus is to create a custom environment that emulates Scriptable's 
execution environment to allow script and widget development on other platforms besides
the iOS app and MacOS desktop app.

This is still a very early on concept, meaning that it is just a plain idea and something to work on. Any contributions/ideas to contribute to the
project are very well accepted.
